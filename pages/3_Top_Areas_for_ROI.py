    In order to figure out NYC's best revenue drivers, I will use pandas to calculate the average price of a rental in a given area, then compare the price gotten by an individual rental to their average.
    
    I am plotting the results of this analysis using Altair.

    I should note that this analysis has brought my attention to some outliers in our dataset. There are some rentals that have extreme prices which are almost never rented out. I have excluded these observations so that our visualization is more readable.

    Great! Now, we can see which rentals are earning the most money relative to the others. I used a bubble plot becuase it allows us to show the relationship between occupied nights and price per night (there isn't much of one) as well as a way to tell which listings were the largest (rate-wise) relative to their competition.

    As we can see, some of these rentals toward the top-middle and top-right of the chart are sold out more than 50 percent of the year, and sometimes going for almost 14 times the price of their competitors. Wow!
